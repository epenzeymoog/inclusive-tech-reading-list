# Inclusive Tech Reading List

`The Inclusive Tech Reading List` is an open source collection of inclusive education resources for topics in technology.

This document aims to provide a comprehensive list of educational resources for various topics in tech that are inclusive.

## Overview
The term "inclusive" refers to an intention of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized. American tech spaces have been dominated by people who are white and male at the exclusion of other groups. Some educational resources created in this culture further alienate groups who are not white or male. No one studying software, data or design should have to suffer through a well-known educational resource that subtly or outright demeans groups of people. There's no reason that an aspiring software developer, eagerly reading a popular book about clean code, should have her learning interrupted by an overt, out of place sexual metaphor that assumes the reader is male, straight, and treats women as sexual objects.

There's no reason to consume content created by well-known names in tech who are sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusive when there are quality, inclusive alternatives available. This project was created to bring those quality, inclusive alternatives together into one place. Learners increasing their knowledge with any of the resources below can rest assured that the resource has been vetted by people in tech who understand oppression and have found the resource to not be problematic.

Creating diverse and inclusive tech spaces is important work that is complex and multi-faceted, and this reading list is meant to be one small step toward that goal.
