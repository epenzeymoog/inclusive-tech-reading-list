## Overview

`The Inclusive Tech Reading List` is an open source collection of inclusive education resources for topics in technology.

This document aims to provide a comprehensive list of educational resources for various topics in tech that are inclusive.

The term "inclusive" refers to an intention of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized. American tech spaces have been dominated be people who are white and male at the exclusion of other groups. Some educational resources created in this culture further alienate groups who are not white or male. No one studying software, data or design should have to suffer through a well-known educational resource that subtly or outright demeans groups of people. There's no reason that aspiring software developer, eagerly reading about clean code, should have her learning interrupted by an overt, out of place sexual metaphor that assumes the reader is male, straight, and treats womens as sexual objects. There's no reason to consume content created by well-known names in tech who are sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusive simply because they are well-known names in tech when there are quality, inclusive alternatives available. This project was created to bring those quality, inclusive alternatives together into one place. Learners increasing their knowledge with any of the resources below can rest assured that the resource has been vetted by people in tech who understand oppression and have found the resource to not be problematic.

Creating diverse and inclusive tech spaces is important work that is complex and multi-faceted, and this reading list is meant to be one small step towards that goal.

## What belongs in this project?

One thing: links to resources for learning about topics in tech (development, data, devops, design, etc) that are inclusive.

"Resources" includes books, webinars, screencasts, online classes, tutorials, and articles.

## What _exactly_ does "inclusive" mean for this project?

We realize that not all books and other learning resources are created by people with a deep understanding of oppression. When thinking about if a resource fits the criteria for this project, it must meet one minimum criteria:
_The resources does not outright or subtly marginalize a specific group of people._

Outright marginalization is usually simple to identify: the author explicitely states that women are inferior coders for x reason. Suble marginalization can be trickier to spot. Three examples of more subtle marginalization from popular books about development and design include:
- A dated male/female relationship metaphor that reinforces gender stereotypes.
- A discussions of how tribal cultures are like "children."
- An aside about wanting to be a "master" who dominates the code as his "slave."
People who have a solid understanding of oppression issues and intersectionality are usually able to pick up on subtle marginalization. We are committed to only including resources on this list that do not outright or subtly contribute to the oppression of marginalized groups.

After meeting this one criteria, we seek resources that meet an ideal criteria: _inclusivity._
This means that not only is the resource free of overt and subtle marginalization, but is inclusive in that it includes diverse groups in its examples, discussions, and more. The creator of the resource acknowledges and treats equitably women as well as men; people of color as well as white people; non-straight people as well as straigh-people; transgender and genderqueer people as well as cisgender people, people with disabilities as well as people without disabilities, etc.

We recognize that many learnign resources about technology do not have the opportunity to demonstrate inclusivity in this way; often there's no reason to even use gendered words when writing about code. This is why demonstrating inclusivity in this way is not a requirement. However, resources that do meet this criteria are noted with an _i_.

## What do I need to contribute?

This project is hosted on Github, so a working knowledge of git is useful. However, the core contributors are happy to talk about this process through issues and pull requests if you are just learning about git and contributing to Open Source. `The Inclusive Tech Reading List` is committed to being an open and inclusive environment, and is a great place to practice your skills and submit your first pull request!

If you are in a field of tech where no knowledge of git is required and learning it is not a useful skill for you, please email inclusivetechreadinglist@gmail.com and we'll review and add your resource.

`The Inclusive Tech Reading List` has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) v 1.4 as our governing Code of Conduct. By submitting an addition to this project via either github pull request or email, you are agreeing to abide by the Contributor Covenant.
